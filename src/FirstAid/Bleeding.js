If someone is bleeding heavily, the main aim is to prevent further blood loss and minimise the effects of shock.

{bullet}Apply direct pressure on the cut or wound with a clean cloth, tissue, or piece of gauze until bleeding stops.
{'\n'}{'\n'} 
{bullet}If blood soaks through the material, donâ€™t remove it. Put more cloth or gauze on top of it and continue to apply pressure.

{bullet}If the wound is on the arm or leg, raise limb above the heart, if possible, to help slow bleeding.
{'\n'}{'\n'} 
{bullet}Wash your hands again after giving first aid and before cleaning and dressing the wound.

{bullet}Do not apply a tourniquet unless the bleeding is severe and not stopped with direct pressure.
{'\n'}{'\n'} 
{bullet}If you have disposable gloves, use them to reduce the risk of any infection being passed on.
{'\n'}{'\n'} 
{bullet}Check that there's nothing embedded in the wound. If there is, take care not to press down on the object.
{'\n'}{'\n'} 
{bullet}Instead, press firmly on either side of the object and build up padding around it before bandaging to avoid putting pressure on the object itself.
{'\n'}{'\n'} 
{bullet}Do not try to remove it because it may be helping to slow down the bleeding.{'\n'}{'\n'}
